It's a pretty simple set of static JS; following the call tree from `renderFlag()` should be fairly simple.

Note that SVG addition can be a little fiddly; minifying and including both dimensions and a bounding box usually yields the best results. Feel free to open a PR if you're having issues and I can do my best to help.
